* 2002-12-06, prelude-lml-0.8.2:

	- Yoann Vandoorselaere <yoann@mandrakesoft.com>: 
	  LML doesn't use pthread anymore, but use more favorable technic
	  where several file descriptor are monitored from a single thread.
	
	- Yoann Vandoorselaere <yoann@mandrakesoft.com>: 
	  Massive reorganisation of the way we're doing file monitoring,
	  we are now able to monitor file change throught FAM instead of
	  polling every file descriptor every second. Be warned that a bug
	  in current Linux Kernel (up to 2.4.20 and 2.5.50) prevent FAM from
	  being enabled cause the kernel won't send file notification event 
	  for writev() issued change. FAM support will only be activated in 
	  case the bug is not present.

	- Yoann Vandoorselaere <yoann@mandrakesoft.com>: 
	  Fix Solaris compilation problem.

	- Krzysztof Zaraska <kzaraska@student.uci.agh.edu.pl>:

	  generated by grsecurity up to version 1.9.7.
	
	- Yoann Vandoorselaere <yoann@mandrakesoft.com>: 
	  Prevent signatures without regex to be compiled in. This fix a 
	  possible SIGSEGV due to a NULL pointer dereference in case a 
	  signatures didn't provide a regex.

	- Nicolas Delon <delon.nicolas@wanadoo.fr>:

	  but file size doesn't increase.
