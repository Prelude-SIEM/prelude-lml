    "tcp-tls-server" option, the defaut port is 6514. The system support
    anonymous authentication using the (anon-(EC)DH) key exchange protocol as
    well as x509 authentication, which might be used with or without client

    may include fingerprint (MD5 or SHA1) and/or name verification with the

    with different options.

- File notification improvement: some case where file notification was
  not working appropriately were fixed. Improve handling of file
  deletion (optionaly followed by file creation event).

- There was various case where the previous code would mishandle the
  metadata write/verification. All known issues are now fixed.

- There was no monitoring for standard input, everything was read once
  upon start and further input was ignored.

- Fix possible truncation of dispatched log, when the string contained
  multiples nul terminator. Fixes a regression of LML 1.0.0rc1.

- Statistics were missing for UDP server input.

- Minor events reporting improvement, and bug fixes.

* 2010-01-29, prelude-lml-1.0.0rc1:

- Support for character encoding and convertion to UTF-8. The user
  can specify a different character encoding for each files.

- Automatic character set detection if none is specified by the user,
  the implementation will attempt to detect the character set used for a
  given file. In case the detection fail, the system default will be
  used.

- Log entry are now converted to UTF-8 before processing. This fixes a
  problem where user could see incorrect characters in reported alert,
  since they were carrying data that could involve differents character
  set.

- Include Snare ruleset, courtesy of Nicholas Nachefski
  <nnachefski@gmail.com>.

  information.

  with slight modification from Pierre Chifflier <p.chifflier@inl.fr>.
  Close #340.

  remove un-needed check that would always evaluate to TRUE.Thanks
  Steve Grubb <sgrubb@redhat.com> for reporting this problem (and
  running flexelint on the Prelude sources)!

- Update for libtool 2.x compatibility.

- This simplify the whole regular expression handling a lot, making the
  code much easier to read, and fixing potential problem with ovector
  assignement. This code should also improve performance by a small
  factor.

  to handle discarded tcp or udp packets.

- Various fixes and update.

- Deprecate Gamin/FAM support in favor of libev: the previous implementation
  had problem on SELinux enabled system due to Gamin server startup being
  triggered by other program, and thus using improper role for Prelude-LML.
  (#326).

- Improved polling architecture by using Operating System specific backend
  when possible.

          New --group (-g) option that take a groupname argument:
          LML will setgid to the specified group if requested. This
          fix bug #0000081.

        - Stephane Loeuillet <stephane.loeuillet@tiscali.fr>:
          Add a new variable type for [source/target].service.port
          (VARIABLE_TYPE_PORT). now, ports could either contain a
          port number or a service name (www would resolve to 80,
          depending your /etc/services).

        - Simon Castro <scastro@entreelibre.com>:
          New IPChains ruleset.

        - John Green <john@giggled.org>:
          Add Vigor xDSl router built-in firewall support.

        - Yoann Vandoorselaere <yoann@prelude-ids.org>:
          Stop using getc_unlocked(). This function is not available
          on some plateform, and we don't need it anymore as we droped
          the threaded architecture.

        - Yoann Vandoorselaere <yoann@prelude-ids.org>:
          Be verbose when we fail opening a logfile.

* 2003-04-24, prelude-lml 0.8.3:

        - Yoann Vandoorselaere <yoann@prelude-ids.org>:
          Implement logfile metadata:

          If there is metadata available and current logfile size is
          less than the specified metadata offset, assume the log got
          rotated, and start analyzing the file at offset 0.

          If there are metadata available and current logfile size is
          more or equal than the specified metadata offset: start analyzing
          the logfile from the specified offset. Unless the checksum doesn't
          match, in which case we'll issue an alert, and restart from 0.

        - Yoann Vandoorselaere <yoann@prelude-ids.org>:
          Should now be able to read up to 2 ^ (64-1) bytes logfile.

        - Yoann Vandoorselaere <yoann@prelude-ids.org>:
          Implemented runtime detection and workaround of the FAM (Dnotify)
          writev() bug. We go back to simple file polling if the bug is
          present.

        - Yoann Vandoorselaere <yoann@prelude-ids.org>:
          Restart LML on SIGHUP, so that log rotation program might
          restart it.

        - Yoann Vandoorselaere <yoann@prelude-ids.org>:
          Implemented handling of the source and destination address,
          by the Simple (signature) plugin.

        - Vincent Glaume <vglaume@exaprobe.com>:
          Implemented handling of the "last" keyword, telling LML to stop
          matching regex against a line of log once one of them has been
          matched.

        - Yoann Vandoorselaere <yoann@prelude-ids.org>:
          LML alert now carry LML version.

        - Yoann Vandoorselaere <yoann@prelude-ids.org>:
          Modified the Debug plugin so that it use the shared LML API
          for sending alert. Also, Debug alert are now low priority.

        - Laurent Oudot <oudot.laurent@wanadoo.fr>:
          Exim ruleset.

        - Stéphane Loeuillet <LeRoutier@wanadoo.fr>:
          ProFTPD, vpopmail, qpopper rulesets.

        - Vincent Glaume <vglaume@exaprobe.com>:
          Squid, NtSyslog, Ipso, Checkpoint, rulesets.


* 2002-12-06, prelude-lml-0.8.2:

        - Yoann Vandoorselaere <yoann@prelude-ids.org>:
          LML doesn't use pthread anymore, but use more favorable technic
          where several file descriptor are monitored from a single thread.

        - Yoann Vandoorselaere <yoann@prelude-ids.org>:
          Massive reorganisation of the way we're doing file monitoring,
          we are now able to monitor file change throught FAM instead of
          polling every file descriptor every second. Be warned that a bug
          in current Linux Kernel (up to 2.4.20 and 2.5.50) prevent FAM from
          being enabled cause the kernel won't send file notification event
          for writev() issued change. FAM support will only be activated in
          case the bug is not present.

        - Yoann Vandoorselaere <yoann@prelude-ids.org>:
          Fix Solaris compilation problem.

        - Krzysztof Zaraska <kzaraska@student.uci.agh.edu.pl>:
          Fix a build problem on FreeBSD

        - Yoann Vandoorselaere <yoann@prelude-ids.org>:
          The Simple plugin now support setting User and UserID fields.

        - Brad Spengler <spender@grsecurity.net>:
          Update grsecurity ruleset. The new ruleset should handle event
          generated by grsecurity up to version 1.9.7.

        - Yoann Vandoorselaere <yoann@prelude-ids.org>:
          Prevent signatures without regex to be compiled in. This fix a
          possible SIGSEGV due to a NULL pointer dereference in case a
          signatures didn't provide a regex.

        - Nicolas Delon <delon.nicolas@wanadoo.fr>:
          New sshd ruleset.

        - Laurent Oudot <oudot.laurent@wanadoo.fr>
          New ZyWall ruleset.

        - Nicolas Delon <delon.nicolas@wanadoo.fr>:
          Updated the Netfilter ruleset so that it is able to match
          packets not received from the LAN.

        - Yoann Vandoorselaere <yoann@prelude-ids.org>:
          Add a COPYING.OPENSSL file, containing the OpenSSL license.
          Permit linking with OpenSSL so that Debian package might be distributed.

* 2002-08-29, prelude-lml-0.8.1:
        - Check strdup() return value, and fix a possible
          memory leak in the udp-server code.
          (Guillaume Pelat).

        - Fix possible assertion when two modifications
          are done in the logfile at the same second.
          (Guillaume Pelat).

        - Fix possible unterminated string.
          (Guillaume Pelat).

        - Fix possible file descriptor leak.
          (Guillaume Pelat).

        - Dup the filename before checking if opening the file
          suceeded, so that re-opening inactive file work again.
          (Yoann Vandoorselaere).

        - Emit an alert if the modification time get modified,
          but file size doesn't increase.
          (Yoann Vandoorselaere).

        - Emit an alert if logfile hard link count reach 0.
          (Yoann Vandoorselaere).

* 2002-07-30, prelude-lml-0.8.0:
        - Initial release.
        - Support for (GrSecurity, NetFilter, Cisco, ZyXel, IpFw, Pax).
