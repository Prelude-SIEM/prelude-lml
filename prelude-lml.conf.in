# Address where the Prelude Manager Server is listening on.
# if value is "127.0.0.1", the connection will occur throught
# an UNIX socket.
#
# This entry is disabled. The default is to use the entry
# located in the Prelude system wide clients.conf. You may
# overwrite the default address for this sensor by uncommenting
# this entry.
#
# [prelude]
# server-addr = 127.0.0.1


# FILES TO MONITOR
#
# You should define the log message prefix-regex and time-format within
# a [format] section. If not specified, the default syslog format will
# be used.
#
# The prefix-regex should contain PCRE named subpatterns to pick out the
# information available in your syslog's prefix.
#
# The available field names are:
#   - hostname
#   - process
#   - pid
#   - timestamp
#
# Please see pcrepattern(3) manpage for help writing the prefix-regex
# In order to set the time-format, please have a look at the strptime(3)
# manpage.
#
# Example configuration for syslog output:
#
# Each [format] section might have several file entry.
# Each [format] section might have several udp-server entry.
#
# If a file or udp-server entry might is listed accross differents
# formats, then the first matching format for a given log entry will be
# used.
#
# Additionally, you can specify a pattern in a file entry. LML will then
# searches for all the pathnames matching pattern according to the rules
# used by the shell (see glob(7)).
#
# Example: file = /var/log/*/*.log
#


# CHARACTER ENCODING
#
# For each files added to a format, a character encoding can be specified
# using the 'charset' option. Example:
#
# [format=MyFormat]
# charset = ISO-8859-1
# file = /var/log/log1
# file = /var/log/log2
# charset = UTF-8
# file = /var/log/log3
# file = /var/log/*.log
# udp-server = 0.0.0.0
#
# This will set the character set for 'log1' and 'log2' to ISO-8859-1, and
# to UTF-8 for 'log3', any files that match '/var/log/*.log', and any log
# entry read from the '0.0.0.0' integrated UDP server.
#
# Note that if no character encoding is specified, the system will attempt
# to automatically detect the encoding used. If the detection fail, then
# system wide default (retrieved from locale LC_CTYPE) will be used.
#

# ALTERING GENERATED IDMEF Events
#
# Within each format, you might use the 'idmef-alter' option to modify
# generated events:
#
# Example: idmef-alter = alert.analyzer(-1).node.location = MyLocation;
#
# Note that 'idmef-alter' will never overwrite an IDMEF path that is
# already set. Use 'idmef-alter-force' if this is what you intend to do.
