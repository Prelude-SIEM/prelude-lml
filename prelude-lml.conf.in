# Files to monitor
#
# You should define the log format / log timestamp format before
# you define a file to monitor. If not specified, syslog format is
# used.
#
# In order to set log-fmt, you can use the token :
# %p (process name)
# %h (hostname).
#
# In order to set time-fmt, please have a look at the strptime(3) manpage.
#
# Example configuration for syslog output:
log-format = %h %p:;
time-format = %b %d %H:%M:%S ;
#
# Example configuration for metalog output:
# log-format = [%p];
# time-format = %b %d %H:%M:%S ;
