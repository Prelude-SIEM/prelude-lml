# Rule format :
#
# For more information about the fields described above and their meaning,
# please have a look to the IDMEF Draft located at :
#
# http://www.silicondefense.com/idwg/draft-ietf-idwg-idmef-xml-07.txt
#
# If one of the IDMEF field you wish to add information too isn't covered in
# the rule language, please take the 5 minutes needed to implement a simple
# parsing function to the simple.c plugin distributed with Prelude LML.
#
# CREATING AND CONTRIBUTING RULES:
# Rulesets that you contribute to the Prelude-LML maintainer should follow 
# these guidelines:
# - Avoid using .+ or .* in regex entries unless actually neccessary.  Doing so
#   will make your rule CPU-costly to implement.
# - At a minimum, include regex, classification().name, 
#   classification().origin, assessement.impact.severity, 
#   assessment.impact.type, impact.description, and last.
# - Put only a single field on each line of your rules.
# - Include a sample log entry with each rule.
# - Gather as many pieces of data, and fill as many IDMEF fields as possible
#   from the log entry.
# - If a similar rule exists in another ruleset (same function, different 
#   software), use the classification().name from the other rule.
# - Use only the actual log message, none of the syslog headers (this generally
#   includes timestamp, originating node, originating process, and pid).
# - Submit new rulesets to the prelude-devel mailing list for consideration.
#
#
# Below you will find a listing of most of the IDMEF fields Prelude-LML 
# accepts.  Where you see an item listed with (), it means that item is 
# indexed.  Indexing starts at 0, so, for example, an event with multiple 
# targets would have the first target listed as target(0), followed by whatever
# IDMEF fields you use.  See the existing rulesets for examples.
#
# - regex:
#   A PCRE regex that should be matched to trigger the alert.
#
# - classification().name: 
#   The name of the alert, from one of the origins listed below.

# - classification().url:
#   A URL at which the manager (or the human
#   operator of the manager) can find additional information about the
#   alert.  The document pointed to by the URL may include an in-depth
#   description of the attack, appropriate countermeasures, or other
#   information deemed relevant by the vendor.
# 
# - assessment.impact.severity:
#   An estimate of the relative severity of the event.
#   Possible values are: low, medium, high.
#
# - assessment.impact.completion:
#   An indication of whether the analyzer believes the attempt that
#   the event describes was successful or not.
#   The permitted values are: failed, succeeded.
#
# - assessment.impact.type:
#   The type of attempt represented by this event, in relatively broad
#   categories.

#
# - assessment.impact.description:
#   May contain a textual description of the impact, if the analyzer
#   is able to provide additional details.

# - source().node.address().address,
#   target().node.address().address:
#   Address that has been attacked/Address that issued the attack.
#   There can be more than one.
#
# - source().node.address().category
#   source().node.address().category
#   The type of address provided.
#   Possible values: unknown, atm, e-mail, lotus-notes, mac, sna, vm, 
#   ipv4-addr, ipv4-addr-hex, ipv6-addr, ipv6-addr-hex, ipv6-net, ipv6-net-mask
# 
# - source().node.name,
#   target().node.name:
#   The name of the equipment. This information MUST be provided if no Address
#   information is given.
#
# - source().node.category,
#   target().node.category:
#   The domain from which the name information was obtained.
#   Possible values are: unknown, ads, afs, coda, dfs, dns, hosts, kerberos,
#   nds, nis, nisplus, nt, wfw
#
# - source().node.location,
#   target().node.location:
#   The location of the equipment.
#
# - source().spoofed,
#   target().decoy:
#   An indication of wheter the source/target is a decoy.
#   The permitted values are: unknown, yes, no.
#
# - source().interface,
#   target().interface:
#   May be used by a network-based analyzer with multiple interfaces to
#   indicate which interfaces this source/target was seen on.
#
# - source().service.name,
#   target().service.name:
#   The name of the service. Whenever possible, the name from the IANA list
#   of well-known ports SHOULD be used.

# - source().service.port,
#   target().service.port:
#   The port number being used.
#
# - source().service.protocol,
#   target().service.protocol:
#   The protocol being used.
#
# - source().service.portlist,
#   target().service.portlist:
#   A list of port numbers beeing used.
#
# - source().user.category,
#   target().user.category:
#   The type of user represented (unknown, application, os-device).
#
# - source().user.userid().
#   target().user.userid().
#   Create a new UserId inside an User object (that may contain several UserId).
#
# - source().user.userid().type,
#   target().user.userid().type:
#   The type of user information represented (current-user, original-user, 
#   target-user, user-privs, current-group, group-privs, other-privs).
#
# - source().user.userid().name,
#   target().user.userid().name:
#   A user or group name.

#   A process name
# 
# - source().process.pid,
#   target().process.pid:
#   A process number
