Prelude is a general-purpose hybrid intrusion detection system, 
written entirely from scratch, in C. Prelude is divided into several parts: 

* The NIDS sensor, Prelude, 
  responssible for packet capture and analyzis,

	- The signature engine,
	  designed to be the completly generic and evolutive, it is currently
	  able to read Snort rulesets. By simply adding parser, it should permit
	  to load rulesets from any NIDS.

	- a series of intrusion detection plugins, 
  	  each dedicated to a particular kind of attack started by Prelude, 

	- a series of protocols plugins,
  	  each dedicated to decoding one, high level protocol.

* The report server, 
  a server which Prelude contacts in order to report an intrusion,
  which generate user readable report using plugins. 

	- a series of reporting plugins,
	  each dedicated to making user readable report (html, syslog, xml, ...)


The interesting part is plugins: you can write your own, dedicated to a 
special intrusion detection that you know of and share it with others. 
For example, bundled with the source is a plugin to detect SYN flooding 
attacks. There is more, and you can write more. Moreover, plugins are 
only called when necessary. For example, Prelude won't call the 
aforementioned plugin when it receives a TCP packet which hasn't got the 
SYN flag set, nor will it call it if it receives an ICMP packet. 

Prelude does take care of IP fragmentation. It works as follows: 
when Prelude receives a fragmented packet, it will add it to the 
defragmentation stack. It stores subsequent fragments of the same 
packet in the stack until it receives the last one. The original 
packet is then reassembled and passed on to the intrusion 
detection plugins. 

Note that all packets, at a fragmented state *and* at a 
defragmented state will be analyzed for security problem. This 
allows for detection of IP fragmentation attacks, for example. 

Prelude also decode TCP/IP options.
